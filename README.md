# 🚀 Tandem – Accountability, Together

Tandem is a **goal-tracking web app with a twist**: instead of just checking off tasks yourself, you select an accountability partner who **verifies your progress through photo evidence**. Whether it’s daily workouts, weekly habits, or monthly challenges—Tandem turns your goals into a shared experience.

Built as a full-stack Progressive Web App (PWA), Tandem combines functionality, security, and a collaborative approach to self-improvement.
